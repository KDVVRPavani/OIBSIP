            <b>PERSONAL LIFE</b><br><br>
            On 19 August 1950, Sudha Murthy was born in a Brahmin family in Shiggaon, Karnataka. Her father Dr R.H. Kulkarni who was a surgeon and her mother
             Vimala Kulkarni supported her in her endeavours right from her childhood and raised young Sudha along with her 
             three siblings. An educated atmosphere in the family instilled in her a passion to do something extraordinary at an early age. 
             Sudha Murthy’s brother Srinivas Kulkarni is a renowned astronomer who received the Dan David Prize in 2017. Her early life experiences 
             and affinity for her grandmother became the foundation for some of her books.<br>
             Sudha's mother always supported her children to achieve high endeavors. It was the family of Sudha Murthy who instilled in her 
             the passion to make enormous achievements and achieve extraordinary things in life.
